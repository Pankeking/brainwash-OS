We are slaves, chained to capitalist stations that siphon what's left of our souls.
We feed the machines and call it progress.
We chant optimization like a prayer, and we obey, because to stop is to starve and to question is to exile ourselves from the tribe.
Work or perish, they say, and somehow, we keep pretending it's a choice.
